LasaurApp
=========

LasaurApp is the official `Lasersaur`__ app. It
has all the functionality to operate this kind of laser cutter:

- load vector files and send them to the Lasersaur;
- file support for SVG, `G-code` (subset), DXF (subset);
- GUI widget to move the laser head;
- pausing/continuing a job;
- firmware flashing;
- handy `G-code` programs for the optics calibration process.

This app is written mostly in cross-platform, cross-browser Javascript
and Python. This allows for very flexible setup. The backend can
either run directly on the Lasersaur (Driveboard) or on the client
computer. The frontend runs in a web browser either on the same client
computer or on a tablet computer.

Architecture
============

The software system is comprised of three parts that reside each in its own
directory:

``/firmware``
  Contains the C language sources and the already compiled binaries of the
  modified `grbl`__ `CNC` controller software that is installed on the `ATmega`
  chip that manages all the circuitry on the `DriveBoard`;

``/backend``
  Contains the Python language sources of the service that runs on the `BBB`.
  It communicates on one side via a serial line to the `ATmega` and on the
  other side with the client that runs the GUI in the web browser;

``/frontend``
  Contains the HTML and JavaScript code used to run the GUI in the web
  browser. It communicates with the `backend` using the HTTP protocol.

Overally the system can be represented in a simple graph as follows:
